# 99000X-Scouting-App
This website is used for the 2019/2020 VEX Robotics Competition, Tower Takeover. 
This website will make scouting for your team much easier. All you have to do it put in how well the opponents are doing, and the program will give you predictions and a strategy for how you can play your match against them. 
This website takes many factors into consideration, such as how long it takes for a team to make 1 stack, how big the stacks are, what colours the team is prioritizing, and much more.
This website was created by 99000X Vikings Robotics.
